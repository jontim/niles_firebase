00:00:00:00 - 00:00:34:00
Speaker 1
Like. All right. Hello, everyone. My name is Mikayla Simpson. I am vice president of Global Research at another Leadership institute. I am thrilled to be here with you today and with our panelists where we are going to discuss neurodiversity in the workplace and basically inclusion through the lens of neurodiversity. So first off, I'd like to introduce our panelists and this is our from the lab session.

00:00:34:01 - 00:01:02:08
Speaker 1
So that means we have scientists and researchers in the room with us. So first, I'd like to introduce Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman. You might have seen him earlier this morning in the keynote. He's the founder of the Center for Human Potential, based currently in California. We have Dr. Suzanne Greer with us, the academic director of the Yang Tan Institute on Employment and Disability at the Current at Cornell University I L.R. School.

00:01:02:11 - 00:01:27:09
Speaker 1
And we also have Dr. Batya Wiesenfeld, the Andre J.L. Khoo, professor of Management and director of the Business and Society Program at the NYU Stern School of Business. So thrilled to have all of you here with us today. So this is mainly going so awesome. Well, thank you, Scott. I'm so excited to meet with them. We've had calls and we've been so excited and so now it's been fun.

00:01:27:09 - 00:01:49:15
Speaker 1
Yeah, it's it's been and it's exciting to have you here on stage with us. So welcome, all of you. And thanks for coming so to kick us off, I will tell you a little bit about an ally We've been doing a lot. And in the field of diversity and inclusion, we've written quite a bit about it in our neural leadership journal.

00:01:49:15 - 00:02:14:28
Speaker 1
In fact, we just published our most recent journal article called Managing Threat in the Workplace. And one of the authors just stepped inside, so thrilled to have him here. We've also published in popular media and we engage in thought leadership in this domain, as you see on the screen. And our newest area of focus is neurodiversity. It is something that organizations have been coming to us and really wanting to know more about.

00:02:15:01 - 00:02:37:02
Speaker 1
So for this summit, we've gathered some thought leaders, researchers, scientists, too, so we can have a conversation more about this. So what does this mean in the workplace? So I will kick us off by going over, you know, what is diversity and why is it important. Then I'll bring in our esteemed panelists to talk about this and more depth.

00:02:37:04 - 00:03:05:14
Speaker 1
So I'm going to share with you some of our thinking around neurodiversity. Thus far, we're seeing that there is this new prioritization of neurodiversity in the workplace among organizations. Not only that, people, just everyday people are wanting to know more about neurodiversity. We found this statistic that was showing that pretty much basically during COVID or during the lockdown, there was this uptick in searches on Google around neurodiversity.

00:03:05:19 - 00:03:29:04
Speaker 1
What does it mean? What are the different types of neurodiversity as you see on on this slide here? So it is really on people's minds. And organizations realize, okay, this is something maybe we're not some maybe some more so than others are understanding there is benefit to embracing neurodiversity in the workplace. You know, we're seeing that it can increase our competitive edge.

00:03:29:06 - 00:04:00:09
Speaker 1
It can lead to higher productivity and performance, more creativity and problem solving, higher engagement. For those of you in the DIY space, what does it sound like? This is also the outcomes we find. And we generally talk about diversity, right? And so again, we can think about this broadly. This is also a diversity issue. Now generally, you know, the conventional wisdom is, well, if we're going to be inclusive as an organization, we really need to distinguish people who are neurodiverse neurodiverse from neurotypical people.

00:04:00:11 - 00:04:22:10
Speaker 1
But research is often saying to be inclusive. We want to understand each person. We want to understand each employee's challenges and each employee's potential, because we all have that in us. And so, you know, with that, you know, again, there's to go a click deeper. There can be different approaches. It doesn't mean one is right or one is wrong.

00:04:22:12 - 00:04:47:02
Speaker 1
One can be this one that you know what there neurocognitive differences again, that will distinguish people who are neurodiverse or neurodivergent from those who are neurotypical. And then there's another approach which which we call the umbrella approach, which is like, look, we all have brains. Each brain is unique and each brain has its own structure and function. So we're all under this umbrella.

00:04:47:05 - 00:05:35:29
Speaker 1
And so, you know, sometimes they can kind of be competing approaches, you know, how do we want to think about this? So, you know, one of the things I'd like to discuss right now are the myths around neurodiversity. And these are some common myths that are out there, one which is neurodiversity that's really all about autism. Now, granted, the term neurodiversity was coined by Judy Singer, and it was around autism, but it has grown now to encompass all kinds of conditions and diagnoses from, you know, not only autism or autism spectrum, ADHD, learning disorders, movement disorders, sensory processing disorders, bipolar anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, Tourette's.

00:05:36:01 - 00:05:58:15
Speaker 1
And I even saw synesthesia on the list. And so it's quite extensive. And again, it seems to be growing, and it's really talking about the neurocognitive differences that we all can have. So that's a long way of saying neurodiversity is not just about autism anymore, or it can be many things. Another one is neurodiversity is a disease that must be cured or eradicated.

00:05:58:15 - 00:06:18:20
Speaker 1
And for people who are like, Wait a minute, I'm a person, I am not, I don't have a disease. You know, this is it's a misconception that it's something that needs to be eradicated. So it is not a disease. It's not something needs to go away. These are aspects of people's experience. In fact, you know, we might talk about it the way people identify.

00:06:18:22 - 00:06:47:07
Speaker 1
You know, I've heard when we talk about autism, there are some people who say, I don't have autism, I am autistic. And and it's to ask people how they identify and how they want to be called another one. NEURODIVERGENT People aren't able to succeed in the workplace. Now, we all have strengths and challenges and we have people who are in our diverse in the workplace, thriving just like the rest of us, or, you know, struggling just like the rest of us.

00:06:47:07 - 00:07:16:11
Speaker 1
So they can totally, completely succeed in the workplace. Another one, neurodiversity only affects men. And I would say that's also not the case. What we find traditionally safe, for example, with autism, for a long time it was often attributed just to males, and it's around like the expectations around females, like the presentation can be different. That's the case with, for example, ADHD.

00:07:16:11 - 00:07:42:07
Speaker 1
ADHD in females presents differently than males. So there are a long time people thought, females don't have that, and then they do. And in fact, Steve Hinshaw, he was one of my my advisors at UC Berkeley in my doctoral studies lead studies with girls with ADHD. He was the first one to do that. So that's all to say there can be conditions or disorders where it's just been identified in males and it's not recognized or misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed in females.

00:07:42:14 - 00:08:10:00
Speaker 1
So that's all to say. Females are also impacted in this, basically, we all are. So with that, you know, we think about, you know, how do we create diverse workplaces and even more so, neurodiverse workplaces and one of these things is, is organizations are really trying are grappling with this and understanding this. One of the things to keep in mind is, you know, how do we you know, to get to inclusive neurodiverse workplaces?

00:08:10:02 - 00:08:30:10
Speaker 1
How do we bridge that that gap, you know, in terms of there are these common understandings about what is neurodiversity. And again, often a lot of it is people think of autism, but there are a whole other many, many different areas which, you know, we'll potentially talk about that we could think about when when it comes to neurodiversity.

00:08:30:12 - 00:09:04:11
Speaker 1
And we need to understand all of that to create more inclusive workplaces. And ultimately, I still go back to we had an ally talk about and this is, you know, our our point of view when it comes to neurodiversity, it's that of neuro inclusion is how do we focus on the neural potential of all employees where we take all of their perspectives and experiences into account, because we believe in that way we can contribute to, you know, a thriving organizational culture when we recognize that and everyone.

00:09:04:13 - 00:09:26:07
Speaker 1
So with that, I would really love to invite our panel into this discussion and find out from you. Okay, This is a map book asked your questions. You can decide which one you want to ask, answer or you can choose. So what is neurodiversity to you from your various backgrounds and why do organizations need to pay attention to it?

00:09:26:13 - 00:09:52:06
Speaker 1
So that's one potentially question you can ask. Answer Another one is how do we take something as broad as neurodiversity, which is understandably not very clearly defined? And there are implications around it, around identity, disability rights, privacy, stigma, and how do we frame that for business leaders without othering, pathologizing or medicalizing or stigmatizing people?

00:09:52:08 - 00:09:55:05
Speaker 2
Wow.

00:09:55:07 - 00:09:56:26
Speaker 1
Either. And if anybody does.

00:09:57:03 - 00:10:33:20
Speaker 2
Yeah, those are big questions. I'm trying to think of a definition of neurodiversity. How I tend to view it is there's any cognitive trait that someone is in extreme on, you know, and I'm talking like one two standard deviations above a mean which is just fancy speak for a big or big difference. You tend to notice they stand out, you know, in some ways, you know and and they also may have certain niches in which they would thrive the best as well and certain niches where they really you know, you put them in that environment and they appear dumb or they appear, you know, like I grew up with a learning disability, I grew up

00:10:33:20 - 00:10:55:24
Speaker 2
with an auditory disability. I thought I was really stupid. And they put me in special education and and in kind of this kind of environment, I felt stupid. But then I forced myself to get out and see what else I was capable of. And I realized I had a talent for music, for instance. And I started to do that, started the orchestra and and realized I could do other things.

00:10:55:24 - 00:11:13:12
Speaker 2
There are things I was good at and so not reduced. So I think is important for workplaces to not reduce a person, first of all, to their neurodiversity, while also recognizing there are certain niches where some of their standout traits, you can view it as kind of a standout trait. That's I never put it that way before, but now I'm putting it that.

00:11:13:14 - 00:11:14:17
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:11:14:19 - 00:11:16:24
Speaker 1
But.

00:11:16:27 - 00:11:51:15
Speaker 3
You know, I would say over the last ten years since we've been working in this area, that our definition has morphed and it's really morphed in response to the community, the advocacy community for people who gets involved. And so have you, you know, definitions and you alluded to that issue is we, we partly humans, we go with the definition now that they've the terminology that many people have asked is using dirt neurodivergent rather than neurodiverse, which they see.

00:11:51:18 - 00:12:22:22
Speaker 3
We all are. And I really like that because it puts us on the continuum, not a particular population. I think that is a promise to start from where inclusion is concerned. And I think asking people themselves if you're interacting with someone who identifies that way and then you look at how do they like the person, is it good, good, learn a good place of humility, which I heard talked about in some of our sessions here to approach the topic and to approach individual people.

00:12:22:25 - 00:12:26:13
Speaker 3
The organization change.

00:12:26:15 - 00:12:28:28
Speaker 4
I agree with both of.

00:12:29:01 - 00:12:30:03
Speaker 3
You.

00:12:30:06 - 00:12:30:27
Speaker 2
That you're just good.

00:12:30:28 - 00:12:33:22
Speaker 1
Just like, yeah, you're kind of clay.

00:12:33:25 - 00:12:38:11
Speaker 4
So I, I think yours is not. But yeah.

00:12:38:13 - 00:12:40:09
Speaker 1
Yeah. So when you speak next time.

00:12:40:11 - 00:13:18:22
Speaker 4
I, I think I want to just emphasize that I think you guys said the things that I was going to say, but you know, just to kind of underline a couple of things. So first of all, that neuro neurodivergent has much has an extraordinary amount of variability, which we've discovered is true about every other category of diversity. And so the biggest problem is the fact that we have this tendency to say neurodivergent and, and we are and then we're kind of we have a picture in our mind of what that is.

00:13:18:24 - 00:13:47:11
Speaker 4
And whenever we do that, we stereotype the people who are neurotypical and the people who we classify as neurodivergent. And that is a part of the problem. And so then I want to kind of and sort of the second piece to underline is your point, which is giving people voice, which turns out to be the most important thing with any effort at inclusion.

00:13:47:18 - 00:14:18:03
Speaker 4
And so giving people a voice so that they can define here's, here's how I think and give everyone in your organization. I mean, I so I'm thinking about this from an organizational standpoint because that's the environment I'm in in the business school. So trying to give everyone in your organization a voice to say, here's how I think, here's the thought processes that come more easily to me, give people feedback on how you see.

00:14:18:03 - 00:14:58:21
Speaker 4
So part of the feedback mechanism is getting mentors and supervisors to be comfortable and thinking about Here's how you're thinking, here's what is valuable about how you're thinking. And then that allows sort of opens up the possibility for the the full array of neurodiverse folks to articulate their what works for them and then be able to look for solutions and which I'm hoping we get to eventually that make make it possible for them to perform at their best in the context that they're in.

00:14:58:24 - 00:15:27:07
Speaker 1
But botches like if you were reading my mind as we're going into that next segment, that basically, you know, what do leaders and hiring managers, supervisors, managers, what do they need to know about this talent pool and knowing that they're already existing in their work or in the workplace, but also those coming in? And so I'd like to turn this question to to Scott to the overarching but more specifically.

00:15:27:07 - 00:15:45:18
Speaker 1
So, Scott, you know, you have experience working with twice exceptional students. That's a term I recently learned about and you research and written about topics around creativity and our conceptualizations around intelligence. So from your unique perspective, what do you think is important for leaders and hiring managers to know?

00:15:45:24 - 00:16:09:17
Speaker 2
Well, first of all, I've been trying I spent my career trying to redefine intelligence beyond the IQ test only and to really have a definition that takes into account a person's motivation, their own personal and their own goals, Like their long term goals. All of us have our own individual long term goals and dreams and desires, and it's not measured well on standard metrics of intelligence.

00:16:09:17 - 00:16:28:07
Speaker 2
But when you get someone unleashed, their passion unleashed, you know, you see a whole next level sort of thing than when you just have someone whose passion is there's no passion. You know, if there's no passion. How many of you have heard of the phrase twice exceptional? I'm just curious. Twice exceptional, Like usually. And then you've heard of it.

00:16:28:07 - 00:16:57:10
Speaker 2
It's usually refer to children who simultaneously are gifted, but also have a learning disability in some way. So it kind of breaks down this false dichotomy we have between like, you're either special ed over here or you're gifted over here. But it acknowledges that there are people with profound challenges and profound strengths. So one thing I would really like business to recognize is even that simple insight, you can have a profound disability and a profound strength in the same person you know is a big one.

00:16:57:12 - 00:17:20:01
Speaker 2
And also that a lot of these disabilities, so-called disabilities in certain contexts, can be very powerful. And one quick example is in the in the domain of ADHD or A.D.D., we've been looking at the brains of people with A.D.D. and what you find is they have a very overactive imagination brain network. So they it's almost like they can't turn it off.

00:17:20:01 - 00:17:45:00
Speaker 2
You know, it's like always on call. It's always and it creates a lot of contagion in their ability to focus. Imagine trying to focus on the world and you constantly have this inner chatter and inner things going on. But if you put them in an environment where you can help them get in the flow state or this kind of state where they're engaged in something that they really love and really absorbed, and it turns out that they can stay in that full state much longer than anyone else.

00:17:45:03 - 00:18:04:05
Speaker 2
So it's actually a superpower that people they have, you know, they have to kind of get in that state in order to unlock it. But that's why, you know, I kind of like the metaphor on unlocking because you would never know it, you know, if you if you stick them on board meetings and you only judge their intelligence based on their ability to focus on your boring meeting.

00:18:04:05 - 00:18:15:23
Speaker 2
Right. Like, you know, you'd be missing out on what they could do if you kind of enact their inner, inner passion and ability to focus on their own inner strength, such as one example.

00:18:16:00 - 00:18:38:06
Speaker 1
Wonderful. Thank you, Suzanne. So in your research, you work with organizations on a very practical level. So what do organizations need to be aware of on when they're considering creating a neuro inclusive interview process and hiring process? What have you seen working that work?

00:18:38:09 - 00:19:05:28
Speaker 3
Well, we it's very much, I think, in line consistent with Scott just said, and that is we got into this because we had been doing research since the passage of the ADA on workplace disability inclusion. And although indeed many people don't identify with this as a disability and I and I think that's probably appropriate, it's this more broader view of strengths and weaknesses I think is a good approach to go.

00:19:06:00 - 00:19:40:20
Speaker 3
What we found is that building a culture of inclusion on the front end of any affirmative hiring process is first of all, very, very important. And we learned about that because we found that although there were a number of companies, mostly tech companies in the beginning, who wanted to affirmatively hire autistic people because they saw the characteristics of hyperfocus, sometimes an ability to be used in computer science related activities is very advantageous as people weren't making it through the screening processes.

00:19:40:20 - 00:20:09:03
Speaker 3
And so we took interest in that and we did some research on what worked and didn't work and who needed to know about it. And indeed the process itself was very unfriendly to neurodiverse individuals. And it has to do with what Scott was just talking about. These were in many cases, extraordinarily capable people who could do these tasks, sometimes far exceeding what their peers could do, but they could not make it through that screening process.

00:20:09:06 - 00:20:56:11
Speaker 3
And the companies working with the individuals learned how to reframe that. We've learned from them. And that is making a much more friendly workplace process on that front end by often getting community agencies that would source candidates. So they made it through a different screening process, a different portfolio on the front end, but having a different kind of process where there was not a staccato set of interviewers all day long process open ended questions which people found far too ambiguous and didn't know how to respond to, and educating recruiters and hiring managers that because someone didn't make eye contact didn't mean that they were unfriendly or unsocial and and grooming them to be able to

00:20:56:11 - 00:21:15:15
Speaker 3
be open to letting people to demonstrate their skills rather than having to talk about their skills. And I think those learnings could apply to many other populations that we screen out who have a difficult time with those more traditional and often very unfriendly interview processes.

00:21:15:18 - 00:21:30:08
Speaker 2
A lot of people in the autism spectrum are truth tellers, right? And that could be really awkward, right? Like, you know, you're in an interview and you tell the boss, you know, like, you know, I don't actually really like what you're doing here at this company. You know, are they going to hire you if you say that?

00:21:30:15 - 00:21:36:28
Speaker 2
But but being the boss and having a little humility, I think maybe we need that kind of truth teller around here, you know?

00:21:37:00 - 00:21:39:01
Speaker 3
Right? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

00:21:39:04 - 00:21:58:29
Speaker 1
very much so. It makes me think even that itself. We've been talking today on a number of topics, including, you know, growth mindset and psychological safety. So even in organization, is there a culture embedded that if you do have a truth teller, for whatever reason, then you can handle it and you can take that as an opportunity to learn and grow, understand other people's perspectives as well.

00:21:59:02 - 00:22:02:17
Speaker 1
It's like, you know, how does the culture influence?

00:22:02:20 - 00:22:21:02
Speaker 3
I'm going to add one more thing, and that is opening up the process even further. Some of the companies would give their questions to agencies that were helping to groom interviewees. We never had that opportunity before. I think people saw it as an unfair advantage in letting people come into the workplace and take a look at the environment.

00:22:21:02 - 00:22:28:14
Speaker 3
So it defuzed anxiety. I think all of us would love a peek inside that interview room before we actually went through the interviews.

00:22:28:18 - 00:22:51:19
Speaker 1
Because it puts us in a much more as an aisle. I speak towards that. You know, we talk a lot about, you know, threat and reward. And if you're in a state where you're not in threat, you're more likely to be receptive to what's happening. And if it's something that's unknown, unexpected. I attended a conference where somebody talked about she placed people who were specifically autistic on the spectrum and also ADHD.

00:22:51:19 - 00:23:13:19
Speaker 1
And she talked about for hiring managers for your job descriptions to be very concrete and literal because some people don't get innuendo or metaphor or flowery language, flowery language. Tell them what's happening that they even some recommend giving snapshots online so people can even see what the workplace looks like. And for employers to consider what are the lighting situation?

00:23:13:19 - 00:23:23:26
Speaker 1
What's the temperature? What are the sounds, what is it smell like? So all these things, how can you make it more hospitable to people? Are more diverse, but also to everyone in a.

00:23:23:26 - 00:23:26:03
Speaker 2
Way nobody wants is bad smelling, right?

00:23:26:09 - 00:23:30:01
Speaker 1
Workers are really loud noises that can be really disruptive.

00:23:30:03 - 00:24:10:02
Speaker 4
I think what you talking about are all the ways that people can customize that are different options. And and the question would be, can we give people some choices? So we're seeing that technology is being used much more in the hiring process, in the interviewing and hiring process, and that those technologies edges like being able to record your interview, you know, have a video interview that is asynchronous and then being able to upload it is something is increasingly being used and and that can be a great option for some folks.

00:24:10:04 - 00:24:38:13
Speaker 4
And it can be actually much more threatening and intimidating for others. And so having the fact is that technology is giving us a wider toolbox. And the thing that we don't do is allow people some choices about what options they can take advantage of. And so sort of thinking about a wide range of, you know, like, would you want to do the interview on Zoom?

00:24:38:13 - 00:25:07:06
Speaker 4
Do you want to do the interview asynchronous? Do you have an in-person version? All of these things, you know, or any number work sampling as as I think everyone on the panel knows, the best predictor of performance on the job of success on the job is work sampling. And I heard Suzanne, you talking about let's let's figure out how we can integrate work sampling into our selection process.

00:25:07:08 - 00:25:49:14
Speaker 4
And it turns out that that is an amazing way of eliminating a lot of the biases against neurodiverse people. Because when you see that they can do the job in in some way, and as you said, not just talking about doing the job, how much that brings out brings out the best in people. And as we're learning, as so many jobs become things that we are discovering, you can do remotely and in other contexts there there are more and more ways we're discovering of doing work, sampling for a wider range of jobs than we had been accustomed to before.

00:25:49:21 - 00:26:01:17
Speaker 4
So I'm hearing each one it's it's sort of that the options, but giving people some choices about those options.

00:26:01:19 - 00:26:11:14
Speaker 2
I don't recommend doing that to college students, though, because they take advantage that way. Right. And there's something with pretty funny story.

00:26:11:18 - 00:26:12:27
Speaker 1
So I'm sure.

00:26:12:27 - 00:26:18:13
Speaker 2
I'm sure, sir, But I can't come up with one question. I get anxiety and I need accommodations that it's.

00:26:18:13 - 00:26:30:22
Speaker 1
Like, well, you know, you're bringing up another topic, right? There's this thing we want to be inclusive, but then where, you know, some people who might take advantage, who might happen. Yeah, you speak a little bit to that.

00:26:30:22 - 00:26:34:25
Speaker 2
But it did add. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well.

00:26:34:27 - 00:26:47:28
Speaker 1
Yeah, well, I'll just say, how do we like in the workplace and manage that, you know, as, as leaders if you might have somebody who will be like, well I couldn't do this because you know, what would you recommend.

00:26:48:00 - 00:27:10:23
Speaker 2
But I think the whole point here, correct me if I'm wrong, is unlocking their potential, you know, getting them involved in situations where they're really performing their best. It's not making their life easier. So that just for just for the sake of not having to do work know they're still doing work, but they're doing work in a way, and they're still working hard, but they're doing in a way that is we're really bringing out their best.

00:27:10:26 - 00:27:12:21
Speaker 2
That's the way I kind of see it. Yeah.

00:27:12:23 - 00:27:38:02
Speaker 3
And I think people know if you're over accommodating and I'm at heart, I don't know what they want that really. I think putting some parameters and kind of continually providing feedback if the boundaries are exceeded because they want to be a part of that community. Right? So I think providing feedback about what's working and not working, why you allow people to test who they are and where they are in that work environment.

00:27:38:02 - 00:27:41:00
Speaker 3
I mean, I think that's very healthy.

00:27:41:02 - 00:28:12:08
Speaker 4
And managers need to set the objectives and articulate for their people. Here's what we're trying to accomplish. And when you articulate clearly, here's what we're trying to accomplish. And then then you articulate this is what this means for your role, and then allow them to say, and here's how I can contribute. You know, so you're allowing people in those roles to say, okay, here's how I can contribute to those larger objectives.

00:28:12:11 - 00:28:37:29
Speaker 4
Then it creates the dynamic of accountability that you actually want, a dynamic that is from from here's really this this isn't just my preference. This is what we're trying to accomplish. Here's the task we have to do. Here's the timeframe. We have to do it. Here are the standards that we're going to be evaluated against. And and then, okay, here's your role within that.

00:28:37:29 - 00:29:03:02
Speaker 4
Then it just I mean, you're still giving people choices of the how, but you've made clear what the larger objective is, which gets their buy in. And then, you know, our motivation, as you said, it's got as well as the ability to then sort of know, okay, here's what I'm going to be accountable for and deliver on.

00:29:03:04 - 00:29:04:27
Speaker 1
Of course. Of course.

00:29:05:00 - 00:29:29:23
Speaker 2
I just love that we're bringing this under the umbrella of the larger diversity umbrella. I think it's really important. I think that a lot of these things are not skin deep, you know, and and we can have stereotypes about things based on skin, skin color that can be damaging, you know, and about gender as well. You know, a lot of women on the autism spectrum and you hinted at this earlier, they really mask the research shows they score high in masking trying to hide that.

00:29:29:23 - 00:29:47:12
Speaker 2
You know, also with autism, we might have certain things in our head, but I am I just helped create a a for a TV show. I just helped create a black autistic character. And, you know, a lot of women, I think, you know, mitochondria. So anyway, I think a lot of stuff transcends skin color, transcends gender. It's it gets a much deeper sort of neurological level.

00:29:47:19 - 00:29:50:26
Speaker 2
And so I'm just really happy to see this underneath that large umbrella.

00:29:50:29 - 00:30:04:28
Speaker 1
And thanks for mentioning that as another aspect of our existence. Right. And our manifestation of that, we show up in the world that we would consider in. And to your point, it's it goes below the skin, right? And it affects all of us.

00:30:04:28 - 00:30:07:15
Speaker 2
And it's not readily apparent when you're someone.

00:30:07:16 - 00:30:36:04
Speaker 1
Right. It can be quite invisible in certain ways. Yeah. Yeah. As well. So to continue the conversation and I loved to talk about some of the work that you've done Boccia in your experience. So you so now this, this I, I wanted to talk about, you know, what do organizations really need to do to embrace neurodiversity in the workplace because we can talk about, you know, these are the best practices maybe, but like, what do they really, really need to do?

00:30:36:07 - 00:30:54:13
Speaker 1
And boccia, you you know, you're in a business school. You you conducted research on organizational effectiveness. And I came across one of your your articles, your papers that talked about prototypes for inclusion. And I was really intrigued by that. So you can tell us more about prototypes for inclusion and how they may help or impede inclusion.

00:30:54:16 - 00:31:26:21
Speaker 4
Yeah, So, so prototypes of prototypes are basically the embodiment of an identity of a group. And we all organizations have a particular identity and they want to very much project that identity. It might be a team or a division, might have an identity and want to project a particular identity. For example, Amazon sort of views being sociable and extroverted as being a critical.

00:31:26:21 - 00:31:58:28
Speaker 4
I mean, that's one of the things that they look for in Amazon and, and are sort of explicit about and, and most people are most of the people who make it through are, you know, have that way of interacting and that sense. And these prototypes are like many stereotypes taken for granted, assumptions that affect organizations more in automatic ways, like stereotypes.

00:31:59:01 - 00:32:32:00
Speaker 4
They are unlike stereotypes. They are defined from within and have their basis in the identity. So they're socially shared. But but based on something that they become prescriptive. Stereotypes are kind of shorthand. They are supposedly descriptive, but they actually don't describe anyone. And prototypes have all this extra strength because they are prescriptive. Here's what it means to be a member of our organization.

00:32:32:06 - 00:32:58:10
Speaker 4
Here's what it means to be a good member of our organization. Prototypes are used to define two kinds of questions Who should be in and who should be out? And they do the up versus down, who is deserving of status and voice and influence and who is less deserving. And the very same prototype is B is used for both of those types of decisions.

00:32:58:13 - 00:33:32:01
Speaker 4
The problem is that there is a natural tendency for these prototypes to become more narrow over time, and that's one of the things that we've been discovering, that organizations, you know, especially in competitive environments, they have a natural tendency to want to differentiate themselves, to say, here's the way we are set apart from all other organizations. And there is a natural weight of those who are in the majority, too.

00:33:32:03 - 00:34:13:10
Speaker 4
They have access to resources, both material and symbolic resources that make their their identity injected into the organizational identity. So those prototypes end up being narrowly defined around the majority group member. And this is true of all dimensions of diversity. It's true. It's basically sort of the white male, cisgender, you know, neurotypical, all the sort of young middle age.

00:34:13:10 - 00:34:50:04
Speaker 4
You know, it's sort of like all of these different dimensions get imbued in these and and they become more narrow over time because of because basically those with those resources can kind of hijack the process to make to make themselves remember it's used to define in versus out up versus down. So if you can influence the prototype, you can influence the, you know, your status in the organization, your opportunity to be selected for leadership and so on.

00:34:50:06 - 00:35:25:10
Speaker 4
So and the more narrow it is, the less competition you have. So there is this natural tendency. So there are things that that we've seen that can be done to broaden these stereotypes, to make them the key thing is to make them, not to make them the their application be equal. We don't necessarily want everyone to be able to come into an or we want everyone to be able to come into an organization.

00:35:25:13 - 00:35:58:00
Speaker 4
But we don't want we recognize that not everyone is going to fit. And it's legitimate to include what is central to the identity of the organization, what's critical to organizational functioning that needs to be part of the prototype. But anything that is not needs to be left out. And so in particular, there are dimensions. Dimensions that are inaccessible and undesirable to people should not be part of the prototype that makes the prototype more exclusive.

00:35:58:02 - 00:36:39:04
Speaker 4
So anything that would require that would be impossible for someone to change or that they wouldn't want to change about themselves should not be part of a prototype. Prototypes work best when they are balanced. One of the things we did with sort of a a fire department that was said they were committed to hiring women but really struggled to accept women, was recognizing that the prototype of the fire department included being physically strong and that and that dimension was the most important dimension.

00:36:39:06 - 00:37:15:01
Speaker 4
Yet everybody recognized that, in fact, there's a lot of fire fire fighters, fire people. The firefighters have to do a lot of things that are not about fighting fires. And a lot of that requires compassion and empathy and being able to relate to others. Things that it turned out were much more relevant to women. And so being able to create more balanced prototypes that incorporate multiple dimensions and don't leave out that physical strength dimension left out women.

00:37:15:01 - 00:37:46:20
Speaker 4
It left out older people, it left out certain races. So it ended up being a very problematic, you know, dimension to prioritize so much. The key thing is with respect to neurodiversity. So sort of bringing it back, what are the prototypes? It turns out that we are that when we looked at prototypes that organizations held, they very often had prototypes about how people think or should think.

00:37:46:22 - 00:38:36:26
Speaker 4
And that is a much more acceptable than many other types of features of how you think. You know, we think this way is an acceptable form of of, you know acceptable feature in a prototype. And so the question would be, well, is that something that we really need to have? And and so I guess when we go beyond when we go beyond the hiring and sort of recruitment and hiring process, it's a recognition, for example, that when we think about a job, sometimes we need people, you know, the jobs end up getting defined by their previous occupants.

00:38:36:28 - 00:38:59:23
Speaker 4
We all know that we've all been in that situation and that that isn't necessarily what that's not necessarily part of the job, part of the role. It's what the prior occupant imbued in that. And so let's figure out what really needs to be part of that role and get rid of the stuff that doesn't belong to counterbalance that.

00:39:00:00 - 00:39:34:22
Speaker 4
Now, that tendency to narrow things like training and and so giving people choices on training, performance appraisal, so being able to which is very important for neurodivergent folks, is being able to articulate clearly in ways that are measurable. Here's what I'm going to be evaluating you on measurable and behavioral, as opposed to, well, we want you to be personable.

00:39:34:22 - 00:39:44:15
Speaker 4
What does personable mean for, you know, and think about all that gets left out when you say personable. So, yeah, I'm sorry. I know that.

00:39:44:16 - 00:40:04:18
Speaker 1
They're so fascinating. I could sit and listen for ever. I want to be mindful of time and just I mean, there's so much there we could go another hour. Discussing this event is completely fascinating. We just love to hear from Suzanne and Scott, like from what you just heard batches say and this especially this prototype for inclusion, what's coming up for you?

00:40:04:24 - 00:40:20:06
Speaker 1
And another core question like, okay, you kind of gave a prescription away for what ways that organizations can do better, for lack of a better word. But are we seeing that in practice? Suzanne, I don't know if you you know.

00:40:20:08 - 00:40:49:19
Speaker 3
We've been since this is about neurodiversity. I'll speak to our experience over the last ten years. One of the reasons why we've stayed so close to the companies that have affirmative hiring programs is we've watched them iterate so quickly to try to be success ful. I think it's a great example of private sector federal sector too, but certainly really wanting to make this work and being willing to pivot as needed when something didn't work.

00:40:49:25 - 00:41:15:02
Speaker 3
You know, they started with product prototypes in mind and recognizing they weren't successful, you know, people weren't making it through that process. And so taking the time to really ask people what was working and not working for them and iterating, going from, you know, six week orientation programs. I mean, at least they were having orientation programs, right? They weren't just screening people out.

00:41:15:02 - 00:41:43:12
Speaker 3
They were giving them a chance to demonstrate. People found it exhausting. And so going moving down to a weeklong program and then during COVID, pivoting to online ways to assess Microsoft again, who was represented here as well, used Minecraft and designed an online experience for people to demonstrate their teamwork skills. A great example of, you know, giving people options, right?

00:41:43:12 - 00:42:23:17
Speaker 3
And now they there continue to use that. The pandemic forced all of us to learn about how workplace practices could be changed. So I think we need to bust those old prototypes. They're there. It's challenging. But if you want the new talent that's available out there, those kinds of things that we're learning from companies that are doing doing neurodiversity, affirmative hiring programs, we have to apply to all this new talent that we want because we each need an opportunity to demonstrate who we are and what we can do in a way that's different than companies have asked for in the past is good.

00:42:23:20 - 00:42:48:06
Speaker 2
And so, so good. Yeah, I just don't like reducing anyone to a single thing. I think that that's I think that's what prototypes kind of do all the research on creativity with a creativity researcher back here as well. I call it a colleague. All the creativity research that I've seen shows that creative people are really good at taking contradictory traits and extremes and putting that in one body and mind.

00:42:48:09 - 00:43:05:28
Speaker 2
So if you just kind of pull out one thing and you're like, no, this is not the prototype that we want here, or this is the product, you might be missing out on it. A complexity here of, wow, this person might be really good for the creative organization because they precisely they do bring things we don't tend to see in one package.

00:43:06:05 - 00:43:09:12
Speaker 2
That's also what you see with their diversity. Yeah. Does that make sense?

00:43:09:15 - 00:43:18:23
Speaker 4
Can I ask a question like so think about creativity in teams. How does neurodiversity work in teams?

00:43:18:25 - 00:43:19:03
Speaker 2
I'm like.

00:43:19:04 - 00:43:36:03
Speaker 1
Well, okay, we do that only because I realize we're short on time and our Mike Renner's there. And I definitely want to give our of our the people in the room a chance to ask questions. I want that too. Maybe we can ask that question. Yeah. Okay. We have a question ask that could has continued with that question.

00:43:36:03 - 00:43:47:19
Speaker 1
But yeah, for sure. I think you thank you.

00:43:47:19 - 00:43:50:16
Speaker 3
This conversation is so enriching.

00:43:50:18 - 00:43:51:29
Speaker 4
I think about.

00:43:51:29 - 00:43:56:04
Speaker 3
Unlocking potential from the point from the time that we're.

00:43:56:04 - 00:43:57:03
Speaker 4
Kids.

00:43:57:06 - 00:43:59:29
Speaker 3
And I get very curious about your views.

00:43:59:29 - 00:44:06:10
Speaker 4
On our traditional schooling system and what, if any, shifts that.

00:44:06:10 - 00:44:09:03
Speaker 3
Are top of mind that we need to be making to unlock greater.

00:44:09:03 - 00:44:11:09
Speaker 4
Potential.

00:44:11:11 - 00:44:12:06
Speaker 1
And allotments?

00:44:12:08 - 00:44:50:08
Speaker 2
Girl, we should get a beer because that's like, my God. Beautiful question. Really quick. I wrote a book called UN Gifted Intelligence Redefined that like it tries to really tackle that specific question. And that wasn't just a plug for my book. But the point is here that we really do need a different way of thinking about intelligence, even as young as possible, where we start to recognize a lot of these quirky traits that could be developing at a very young age and instead of like, say, go to detention, because you have these quirky, we actually like, there's something different here, you know, or even just like go to special ed, you know,

00:44:50:14 - 00:45:02:19
Speaker 2
like and report to special ed. You're different. We say, you're different. Yes. And there's a lot we can build off of that. That's my quick answer. But I love the question so much.

00:45:02:21 - 00:45:26:25
Speaker 3
I'm just going to say I see some wonderful content here. This this conference is new for me, and it's the reward versus kind of punish or discourage. And we all need that. And if a child is different, they get far more discouragement than they get encouragement. Young children with disabilities is our and it may not even be explicit.

00:45:26:25 - 00:45:56:13
Speaker 3
It's implicit are told very early on they can't accomplish and that they may never work. And then at age 14 to 18, getting them to think about careers is almost impossible because they've had that negative messaging for so long. But that's true for all children, right? Is we need to tell them they are perfect the way they are and to demonstrate that to the maximum while we give them parameters so they can function in community, we should be able to do both.

00:45:56:17 - 00:46:04:03
Speaker 3
And we have not as yet approximated that model yet. That prototype, a good prototype, a good.

00:46:04:05 - 00:46:05:26
Speaker 1
But you don't have that with you.

00:46:05:29 - 00:46:11:25
Speaker 4
Education. Yeah. I don't feel as nearly as equipped as you guys.

00:46:11:27 - 00:46:32:27
Speaker 1
Well, I just want to know time and I want to thank you for your attention. I don't know if are Well, I mean, it throws one more question. Okay. Well, and if you have to leave. yes, we have a question right there. So understanding some people have to leave. We please do so. But no, that's okay. Well, one word.

00:46:32:27 - 00:46:34:07
Speaker 1
We'll do one more question.

00:46:34:10 - 00:46:50:01
Speaker 3
I think a lot about neurodiversity and working remotely or in the office. And this is a subset of the larger conversation that we're having about in which conditions do people do their best work. And I know that certain neurodiverse.

00:46:50:06 - 00:46:51:05
Speaker 4
Or.

00:46:51:07 - 00:47:18:06
Speaker 3
Populations may prefer working from a home, others may not, particularly ADHD populations, and how we might think about how to enable people to do their best work, even when the conditions are completely contrary to the context in which they might need to thrive. And how we think about that, especially because it seems like more people.

00:47:18:06 - 00:47:19:06
Speaker 4
Prefer working from.

00:47:19:06 - 00:47:30:08
Speaker 3
Home than not. But for people with ADHD who do prefer going to the office, how do we move forward? And especially as it relates to enabling creativity, innovation in organizations.

00:47:30:10 - 00:47:45:14
Speaker 2
COVID has changed a lot of the way we naturally work and giving more people options to work from home. And I think it's actually been beneficial for neurodivergent people. You kind of answered it in one way, is giving people more choice on how they how they work.

00:47:45:16 - 00:48:05:27
Speaker 3
Yeah, I couldn't agree more. You know, for all types of people, employers have said no to homework for years for people with chronic health conditions, and it was exhausting for them to be in transportation. And now we've found out there's no reason to say no if somebody really has a reason to work at home. I mean, you can accommodate, right?

00:48:05:29 - 00:48:27:01
Speaker 3
And that's true. Neurodiversity is one of those places where we saw people thrive because they didn't have to deal with bad smells and other things in the work environment. But many, many of us thrived, right, Because we had choices we never were given before. And I think that's what it's really all about, is creating opportunities for individuals to thrive.

00:48:27:03 - 00:49:07:10
Speaker 4
But there are some challenge ideas from for collaboration. So people who have very different cognitive tendencies, they adapt better to one another when they are proximal. And so figuring out how to, you know, how to kind of maximize the time so that if there needs to be collaborative work now that probably it's only a subset. But if there needs to be collaborative work being done and there isn't already an established way of interacting with one another, then trying to facilitate co-location might actually be helpful for some folks.

00:49:07:11 - 00:49:09:14
Speaker 3
Obviously. It's a great question. Very good point.

00:49:09:15 - 00:49:17:28
Speaker 1
Yes. Thank you so much. I wish we could stay longer. I really want to thank Scott and Suzanne and Boccia for coming and joining us today.

00:49:17:28 - 00:49:24:00
Unknown
Thank you so much.

00:49:24:02 - 00:49:25:11
Speaker 1
All right. I think I might have.

00:49:25:14 - 00:49:45:10
Speaker 2
Thank you, David. I.
